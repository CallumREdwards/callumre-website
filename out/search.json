I have since been working as a Software Engineer at G-Research, a leading quantitative research and technology firm.\nMy technical interests currently lie in Machine Learning, Distributed System Design, Data Engineering, Functional Programming Languages and Mathematics. I decided to create this blog to document and share any new projects/learnings in these areas.\nPlease reach out if you have any suggestions or comments! My email is edwards.callumr@gmail.com."
