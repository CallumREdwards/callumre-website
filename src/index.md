I'm Callum. I graduated from Trinity Hall at the University of Cambridge in Sept 2021 and have since been working at G-Research as a Software Engineer. My interests currently lie in serving data at scale, machine learning, distributed system design, DevOps and programming languages (I especially love Kotlin and functional programming). I'm looking forward to sharing any new projects/thoughts in these areas on this blog. I'd really appreciate any ideas or feedback you might have while reading them so please feel free to reach out and contact me.
