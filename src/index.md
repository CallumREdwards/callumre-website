I'm Callum. I graduated from Trinity Hall at the University of Cambridge in Sept 2021 and have since been working as a Software Engineer at G-Research. My intrests currently lie in Distributed System Design, Data Engineering, DevOps, Programming Lanaguages (I espically love Kotlin and functional programming lanaguage) and Machine Learning. I'm looking forward to share any new projects/thoughts in these areas on this blog.
